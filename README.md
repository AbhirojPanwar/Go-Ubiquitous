Android Developer Nanodegree - Udacity - Project 6 - Go Ubiquitous

## Description
Android Wear is an exciting way to integrate your app more directly into users’ lives. As a new developer, it will be important for you to understand how to perform this integration. This project gives you an opportunity to design a companion app for Sunshine, tying it to a watch face in order to enrich the experience.
